# Polynomial Regression

Comparing Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.

The advantage of using Polynomial Regression:
1.  Polynomial provide best approximation of relationship between dependent and independent variable.
2.  Polynomial regression allows for curved or nonlinear relationships. This means that it can better fit data that doesn't follow a straight line pattern.
